# Telescope access and data export
#####################################################################

_____/ Access to the SRT servers \_____

Currently access is two-step process: 
PC -> NewSRT (server) -> OldSRT (server)

0. (falls extern) erstelle VPN Verbindung zum Uni-Netzwerk
1. Install remote desktop client (e.g. Remmina) and create session to access NewSRT.
   Create connection: RDP
   server: srt2025.mw.iap.unibe.ch
   username: SRT
   password: SRT,user
   Shared folder (on Remmina): choose some folder on your computer for transferring data (***)
3. On NewSRT, you find "OldSRT.rdp". That sets up the remote connection to OldSRT.

_____/ Start the measurements \_____

1. On the OldSRT server, open the labview program: "C:\Users\SRTPraktikum\Desktop\SRT.vi"
2. Store your measurements here: "D:\SRTMeasurements\SRT_HS25"

_____/ Visual telescope monitoring \_____

There are two camera. Both can be accessed from NewPC - Reolink.
- Camera 1 shows the telescope. This camera can also be accessed from your PC.
  http://srtcam.mw.iap.unibe.ch
  username: SRT
  password: SRT,user
- Camera 2 is mounted on the telescope, approximately pointing along antenna boresight.
  https://192.168.1.4/?1758024379195
  username: SRT
  password: SRT,user

_____/ Copy data to your computer \_____

At the moment, a practical way is the following:
1. On NewSRT: open file browser and type \\tsclient (***: this should show a link to your PC)
2. Copy the data from OldSRT to NewSRT \\tsclient
3. Copy the data to the desired location on your computer.
... if you would suggest another more practical method e.g. via shell, please feel free to share it.

_____/ Reading the data \_____

The data has an old hdf5-alike format that can be opened with HDFView2.8 installed on OldPC.
However, the format seems somehow non-standard.
Matlab can read the file, but other modern versions of HDFView/numpy/... have problems with it.
Suggestion: convert the data to json, e.g. here: https://myhdf5.hdfgroup.org/
... any better solution is of course very welcome!

# Comments

Peculiarities of the measurement setup.
- Unknown: currently the spectrum has lots of spikes (whereas it should not)... the reason is not quite clear. Any idea?
- Caution: spectrum might be swapped (just a relict of the measurement process and nothing to worry): just swap if necessary based on your interpretation of the rotation curve.

To keep in mind for the report.
- Concise and readable text with logic thread. Suggestion for efficiency and logic: 
  1. Write outlines for each section (not continuous text).
  2. Write continuous text.
- Use clear/unambiguous and consistent notation for math. symbols.
- "Theoretical exercises" need not necessarily be answered one by one. You can also address the questions in a well-formatted main body of text.
- References: complete and well-formatted. Book references with page number. No internet references.
- Value uncertainty propagation (generalized least squares, ...).
- Extra exercises can be customized: rotation curve, conceptual interests, ...

Submission.
- PDF-report (start drafting early. 
- Data (please use logic filenames).
- Code:
  > Please use comprehensible structure and comments.
  > Different scripts for different analysis/plots (use logic filenames that can be easily linked to data).
- Outputs: figures generated/exported from code (use logic filenames that can easilb be linked to code/data).
